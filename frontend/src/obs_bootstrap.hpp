// Brings libobs up inside the CEF-hosted browser process and tears it down.
// Start() initializes the core, the video pipeline (D3D11), and audio, then
// curated-loads obs-browser (frontend owns CEF) and creates a test scene with a
// browser source bound to output channel 0. Stop() reverses it, draining the
// deferred-destruction queue before obs_shutdown.
//
// TeardownScene() releases the test scene + browser source. It MUST be called
// while CEF is still pumpable: BrowserSource::Destroy() only *posts* its
// `delete this` to TID_UI, and ActuallyCloseBrowser posts the CEF close -- both
// drain only via the CEF message loop. The caller (main.cpp) runs this and then
// pumps CefDoMessageLoopWork() before Stop()/CefShutdown().

// result + IsCanvasLive + first status, StopOutput, assert it left the live set,

// because the mix now exists) and confirm IsCanvasLive flips for that canvas.

// listed in the canvas yet ISOLATED from the global scene list, and that a source
// added to the canvas lands in the canvas's current scene, not output 0. Removes

// additional surface's OWN state (selection flips, item moves) while the Default
// surface's selection and the global output-0 scene are untouched -- i.e. no
// cross-surface bleed. Removes the temp canvas afterward; never Saves. Gated by

void RunPreviewSurfaceIsolationSelfTest();
// Headless proof for the audio mixer: drive audio.list, a setDeflection

// volmeter attaches to a real audio source. The default color source has no
// audio, so this creates a temporary audio-capable source (added to output 0's

// removes the temp source + restores state. Gated by the caller to the smoke path.

// close it, leaving no state behind. Also logs the monitor count. Gated by the
// caller to the smoke path.
void RunProjectorSelfTest();
// Headless proof for hotkeys: drive hotkeys.list (expect > 0, including the
// frontend Start/Stop Streaming), then a hotkeys.set -> hotkeys.list round-trip on
// one hotkey (bind Ctrl+Shift+F12 via a {code:"F12",ctrl,shift} call, confirm it
// reads back), then clear it so the run leaves the binding as it found it. Gated by
// the caller to the smoke path.
void RunHotkeysSelfTest();
// Headless proof for the stats snapshot: drive stats.get through the bridge and
// confirm general.fps / general.cpu are present and 'outputs' is an array sized to
// the enabled-binding count. Live bitrate/drop numbers need a real broadcast, so
// this only verifies shape + that the general stats populate. Gated by the caller
// to the smoke path.
void RunStatsSelfTest();
// Headless proof for the embedded MCP server: spin up a test McpServer (in-process
// HandleRequest, no real socket), then drive initialize / tools/list / a
// tools/call obs_call(scenes.list) and assert the round-trips, plus a go-live
// gating check (allowGoLive=false blocks multistream.startOutput before it
// executes). Touches no config file (StartForTest does not Save). Gated by the
// caller to the smoke path.
