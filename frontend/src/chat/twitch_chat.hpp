// The Twitch chat transport (Phase 9.0): IRC-over-WebSocket against
// wss://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv:443, read + send over one persistent socket. Owned
// by TwitchProvider and handed to the ChatHub via StreamProvider::chat(). The hub
// runs connect() on a dedicated worker between go-live and stop; send() is invoked
// from a separate hub worker, so every libcurl handle access is serialized by
// wsMutex_ (libcurl easy handles are not safe for concurrent use). connect() is
// itself serialized by runMutex_ so an overlapping re-Start (the hub does not join
// old workers) never drives two read loops over the same socket.
