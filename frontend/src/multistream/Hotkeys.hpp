// owns (Start/Stop Streaming). libobs already FIRES bound hotkeys on its own: the
// hotkey thread (started in obs_startup) polls the OS keyboard via GetAsyncKeyState
// on Windows and invokes each bound hotkey's callback globally -- so once bindings
// are loaded they "just work" with no key-event injection or keyboard hook needed.
