# OBS MultiStream — Roadmap

Native multistreaming built into this OBS Studio fork via **canvas / output
multiplexing**: canvases (resolution + fps + encoder settings) become the unit
of streaming, each wired to one or more destinations. Built on OBS's existing
`obs_canvas_t` + output primitives rather than a rewrite, to keep the capture
and plugin ecosystem.

This is a **private fork**, not submitted upstream. The app is rebranded
"OBS MultiStream."

Status legend: ✅ done · 🔧 in progress · 🐛 open bug · 🔭 planned · 💭 in design
· ⏸ deferred

---

## Phase 1 — Canvas foundation ✅ COMPLETE

The Default Canvas is the single source of truth for the main video pipeline
and the one streaming output. Streaming-only (1 video + 1 audio encoder per
canvas); recording, replay buffer, and multitrack/GoLive are hidden and inert.

- ✅ **Data model + persistence** — `CanvasDefinition`, `CanvasManager`,
  global `canvases.json`, per-scene-collection `canvas_bindings`.
- ✅ **Settings → Canvas tab** — add/remove canvases (immediate + auto-saved,
  like profiles); Default card pinned, additional-canvas grid.
- ✅ **Canvas editor dialog** — name/resolution/fps + Video | Audio | Advanced
  tabs (`OBSPropertiesView`); "Use Default" inheritance toggles.
- ✅ **Inheritance & color resolution (4a)** — per-field inheritance from the
  Default Canvas resolved at encode time (`ToVideoInfo`).
- ✅ **Output rewire & tab removal (4b)** — Default Canvas drives
  `obs_reset_video` + the stream encoder via an always-Advanced output handler;
  Settings → Output and Video tabs removed; all color settings moved onto the
  canvas; recording/replay/GoLive UI hidden.
- ✅ **Full inert pass (4b T7)** — recording and GoLive made truly dormant
  (GoLive never constructed, no record/replay auto-start or hotkeys, encoder
  seeding validated). See `docs/superpowers/` specs/plans (gitignored).
- ✅ **Settings polish** — Canvas tab moved below Stream; themed Canvas list
  icon across all themes.

### Tooling ✅

- ✅ **`magefile.go`** — `mage build` / `buildAll` / `run` (portable) /
  `format` / `configure` / `deps` / `tag`. Captures the VS-bundled
  cmake/clang-format paths, portable-mode launch, version-tag fix, and the
  Norton TLS-revocation dependency prefetch.

---

## Open bugs 🐛

- 🐛 **"Use Default resolution" toggle stretched full-width** in the canvas
  editor — the idian `ToggleSwitch` fills its layout cell and reads like a
  slider, though it behaves as a toggle. Fix deferred pending the Phase 2
  editor/dock decision (the control may relocate).
- ⏸ **Pre-existing `verticalLayout_35` AUTOUIC name-collision warning** —
  cosmetic; uic auto-renames. Not introduced by this work.

## Verification owed (manual, can't be driven headlessly)

- 🔧 **Live streaming** — partially exercised; confirmed Phase 1 streams the
  Default Canvas only (additional canvases not yet wired — see Phase 2).
- 🔭 **GUI visual passes** — Settings tabs, canvas editor, control panel hide
  state across themes.
- 🔭 **2a scene model (runtime)** — code-complete but unverified live: create a
  2nd canvas + scene + current-scene, restart, confirm it survives (no collapse
  onto main); Add Source defaults to the existing source; Settings/plugin-added
  canvases get a default scene. Scene-link sync stays dormant until the 2b UI
  populates the link map.

---

## Phase 2 — Multi-destination 🔧 2a–2e + 2b code-complete, live broadcast owed

The goal: each canvas streams to its own destination(s) simultaneously — one
encode per canvas, fanned out to many platforms (Twitch + YouTube + Kick + …).
This closes the Phase 1 seam where additional canvases are definitions only.

**Model decided: per-canvas scenes over shared sources** (Model 1). Each canvas
owns its own scenes (normal OBS scenes); sources stay global/shared, so a canvas
scene references and positions them. Layout is per-canvas (transform/visibility);
content is shared (properties/filters/name). "Link scene" = activation sync
(switch main program scene → linked canvases follow). Rejected Model 2 (one base
scene + per-canvas overrides) as a high-cost custom layer. This **revises** the
Phase 1-era "canvas references one shared scene" decision (which only held for
same-aspect canvases). Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-canvas-
multidestination-design.md`. Surfaced as **dockable canvas windows** (preview +
scene tree + 🔗 link + per-canvas output), all dockable, phased visibility.

SE.Live failure modes explicitly designed against: broken Link scene; broken
canvas CRUD; a non-switchable "primary" destination forcing re-encodes; GPU
blowout/FPS drops from redundant encodes; frame-skips invisible to OBS Stats.
Our fixes: working uuid-keyed link; reuse Phase 1 CanvasManager CRUD; no
privileged primary; one encode per canvas, shared where settings match; native
`obs_output_t` per destination so OBS Stats see everything.

**Build decomposition (each: spec → plan → implement):**

- ✅ **2a — Scene model** — per-canvas scenes over shared sources, scene-link
  activation sync, Add-Source "use existing" default. Plan:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-14-canvas-scene-model.md` (built on libobs's
  `obs_canvas_scene_create`/`obs_canvas_set_channel`). **Code-complete**
  (build-green + two-stage reviewed; GUI runtime verification owed). Capstone
  fix: a Phase-1 carry-forward bug had additional canvases created in `OBSInit`
  then destroyed by `ClearSceneData` before the collection loaded, so their
  scenes/bindings restored onto the main canvas. Now recreated inside `LoadData`
  (after the clear, before `obs_load_sources`); bindings applied after sources
  load; default scenes seeded only for still-empty canvases. **2b/2c must keep
  additional-canvas creation in the load path, not `OBSInit`.**
  Phase 2 was re-decomposed into ordered sub-phases 2c → 2d → 2e → 2b; all are
  now on `canvas-foundation`:
- ✅ **2c — Streams tab** — global, reusable stream profiles (`streams.json`),
  master-detail Streams settings page, primary-only mirror into OBS's single
  `obs_service`. Build-green + GUI-verified (persistence, primary mirror,
  Cancel-discards).
- ✅ **2d — Outputs tab** — an output = (stream profile × canvas) + `enabled`,
  persisted per scene-collection (`output_bindings`). Settings → Outputs routing
  page grouped by canvas with a searchable profile dropdown and a single-key
  in-use guard. Build-green + GUI-verified (persist across restart, in-use block).
- ✅ **2e — Multistream engine + dock** — encode-once-per-canvas fan-out
  (`MultistreamOutput`), one `obs_output` per enabled binding driven by its
  profile's `obs_service`, handler-level single-key guard, and a Multistream dock
  (per-canvas groups, status dots, Go Live / Stop All). Build-green + GUI-verified
  to the connection-failure (Error) path; a real sustained broadcast is owed
  (needs live creds — see `docs/issues.md` #2).
- ✅ **2b — Dockable canvas windows** — one dock per additional canvas: a scene
  list + an `OBSQTDisplay` of that canvas's mix, splitter auto-orienting from the
  dock shape, layout persisted by canvas uuid. Build-green + GUI-verified
  (scene add scoped to canvas, persistence across restart, clean teardown).

### Canvas-dock UX iteration (batch 2) ✅ 2026-06-16

Reworked the canvas-preview UX around **Settings → Outputs as the single source
of truth**, plus supporting fixes. All build-green and GUI-verified by the user.

- ✅ **Output-gated previews** — a canvas renders a preview only when it has ≥1
  enabled output binding (`OutputBindings::AnyEnabledForCanvas`, pushed via the
  `OBSBasic::OutputBindingsChanged` signal). The Default canvas keeps the central
  preview and swaps to a **canvas-agnostic** "Preview Disabled — enable a canvas
  in Settings → Outputs" placeholder until enabled.
- ✅ **Additional canvas docks appear-on-enable** — each additional canvas's dock
  is created **floating** only while it has an enabled output and is destroyed
  when disabled, reconciled live off `OutputBindingsChanged`.
- ✅ **Canvas-dock anatomy** — in-dock per-scene source tree, section
  headers/divider/toolbars, a footer (canvas-editor `⚙` + polled live-status `●`),
  and per-scene `🔗` link toggles (Model-1 activation sync to the program scene).
- ✅ **Point-4 considered and reverted** — briefly made the Default preview a
  dockable panel; it collapsed the central widget and starved the layout, so it
  was reverted. Default preview stays the central widget; stock Scenes/Sources
  docks untouched.
- ✅ **Stream-profile duplicate validation** — block a profile that reuses
  another's stream key (exact) or display name (case-insensitive `Platform -
  Name`) at every commit point; fixed the panel button clipping and the
  stale-list-on-Apply.
- ✅ **Canvas editor / cards** — resolution presets up to 4K (landscape +
  vertical, combo still editable); cards show friendly encoder names via
  `obs_encoder_get_display_name`.
- ✅ **Theme cleanup** — removed the dangling `qproperty-videoIcon` (no matching
  Q_PROPERTY since the Video tab was folded into Canvas) that logged on every
  Settings open.

### Hardening & cleanup pass ✅ 2026-06-19

A low-risk cleanup + the high-value items from the Phase-2 holistic review
(`docs/issues.md` #3). All build-green; runtime-unverified items noted.

- ✅ **Cleanup pass** — deduped the State→color status palette into
  `MultistreamOutput::StateColor`; removed dead members (`SetPrimary`,
  `AnyActive`, 2-arg `Unset`) and two dead locale keys.
- ✅ **R1 — `OBSBasic::ForEachStreamableCanvas`** — hoisted the duplicated
  "Default-first then non-ephemeral canvases" walk; routed the two true-dup sites
  (Multistream dock, Outputs tab) through it. The Stream-tab / SceneCollections
  walks were left alone (drifted intent).
- ✅ **C2 — deleted-profile surfaced distinctly** — a binding pointing at a
  deleted stream profile now reads as "profile deleted" (dock row + Outputs badge)
  rather than identically to an unset one.
- ✅ **P2 — incremental dock refresh** — split `MultistreamDock` into structural
  `Refresh` vs. status-only `UpdateStatuses`; status ticks no longer rebuild the
  tree. Also fixed a latent staleness bug (dock didn't refresh on binding edits
  while visible) via a new `OutputBindingsChanged → Refresh` connection.
- ✅ **H1 — live canvas-edit crash guard** — editing an additional canvas's
  resolution while it was live on a multistream output called
  `obs_canvas_reset_video` unguarded (UAF). Added `MultistreamOutput::IsCanvasLive`
  and guarded both reset sites (direct edit + Default-branch follower loop);
  warn/revert gated to actual resolution/FPS changes. The editor dialog also
  **locks** the resolution/FPS inputs while the canvas is live, with the guard as a
  backstop. Runtime-unverified (needs a live output, same constraint as #2).

---

## Phase 3 — Per-canvas editing & studio mode 🔭 PLANNED (not started)

The Phase-2 model lets an additional canvas be *populated* but not visually
*laid out*, and studio mode / the central editable stage are Default-only. Phase
3 closes that. Each item needs a scoping spike before planning — the central
preview (`OBSBasicPreview`) is OBS's most load-bearing widget and assumes the
main program canvas in several places.

- ✅ **3a — Editable canvas-dock previews (keystone) — IMPLEMENTED (build-green +
  reviewed; GUI acceptance owed).** The canvas dock now hosts an `OBSBasicPreview`
  bound to its canvas, so sources in a canvas dock are draggable / selectable /
  stretch / crop / rotate, scoped to that canvas's scene. Done via **Approach A**:
  parameterized `OBSBasicPreview` with a `targetCanvas` member (default `nullptr` =
  the central preview's exact prior behavior); `TargetScene()`/`TargetVideoInfo()`
  route scene + base-resolution, a per-surface `surface*` viewport decouples
  paint/hit-test, and a self-contained `CanvasPreviewRender` draw callback paints
  `obs_canvas_render` + the editing overlays. Plan:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-20-editable-canvas-previews.md` (5 tasks, commits
  `69f4d59e`..`cbf227c5`). Per-task spec+quality reviews + a holistic final review
  all passed (null-path invariant, multi-dock isolation, no stale-viewport window).
  **Owed:** the manual GUI acceptance pass (drag isolation across docks, teardown,
  live-canvas edit) — can't be driven headlessly. Out of scope (→ 3b/3d): per-canvas
  undo, Studio Mode, nudge, scrollbars, source-list context menu. Unblocks 3b.
- 🔭 **3b — Per-canvas Studio Mode.** Make preview/program staging + transitions
  work per canvas, not Default-only. Superset of 3a (adds per-canvas transition +
  program staging on top of an editable surface); the hardest item. Do after 3a.
- 💭 **3c — Default-preview / canvas-in-center layout (decision deferred).** Two
  related questions about the QMainWindow **central widget** (which dock widgets
  can't occupy):
  - When the Default canvas is output-gated (disabled), should the central
    "Preview Disabled" placeholder *collapse* (`hide()` it — Qt's `display:none`
    equivalent) so the space is reclaimed, accepting that surrounding docks reflow
    into it (Scenes/Sources may balloon — the point-4 "starved layout" risk)? Left
    as today's in-place placeholder for now; **decide later**, ideally with a quick
    reversible `hide()` experiment to judge the reflow in a real layout.
  - **"First-enabled canvas wins the center" — shelved.** Letting any canvas occupy
    the central editable stage via runtime reparenting + a primary-canvas state
    machine. Rejected as invasive surgery for marginal gain; the real need (editing
    a non-default canvas) is better served by 3a's editable docks. Default-in-center
    + additionals-floating is the shipped model.
- ✅ **3d — Canvas-dock editor parity (scenes & sources lists) — IMPLEMENTED
  (build-green + reviewed, GUI acceptance owed) 2026-06-20.** Commits `873846694`
  (add-source core gains optional `targetScene`), `6f1e99ec1` (`OBSBasicSourceSelect`
  3-arg ctor + canvas-aware undo — `SetCurrentScene` gated behind `!isCanvas`),
  `3537d61f` (dock `+` opens the full picker scoped to the canvas scene), `69f011d82`
  (`OBSBasicTransform` derives its scene from the item, not `GetCurrentScene`;
  item-scoped Reset; canvas detection via owned `obs_source_get_canvas` refs),
  `570a4268c` (source + scene right-click menus on `CanvasDock`), `c624fdca7`
  (extracted shared `ResetSceneItemTransform` into `frontend/utility/`). Plan:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-20-canvas-dock-editor-parity.md` (gitignored).
  Reuse-not-rewrite: threaded an optional target scene through OBS's existing
  add-source/transform dialogs (program path byte-for-byte unchanged) and
  reimplemented only the context-menu shells, all canvas-scoped via 3a's
  `SelectedSceneItem()` / `GetCanvasCurrentScene(canvas)` seam. Holistic review =
  SHIP (no program-scene leak — every `GetCurrentScene`-family hit is a program
  fallback or `!isCanvas`-gated; multi-dock isolation sound; teardown safe). **GUI
  acceptance owed** (headless-undriveable): two-dock isolation, canvas add undo/redo,
  Edit-Transform-open-then-destroy-dock, full type-picker attaches to canvas scene.
  Excluded by design (main-window-only): Multiview, projectors, grouping/multi-select,
  copy/paste, interact, grid mode, Studio Mode. Original scope below:
- 🔭 **3d (original scope).** The canvas dock's
  scene/source lists are stripped down vs the main window's; bring them to parity:
  - **Add Source** — the dock's `+` (`CanvasDock::AddSource`) only lists *existing*
    global input sources to attach (Model 1: shared sources), so it shows however
    many inputs already exist. The main window's `+` opens the source-*type* picker
    to *create* a new source. Add a "create new source" path to the dock (likely
    reuse `OBSBasicSourceSelect`, scoped to the canvas scene) so new sources can be
    made from the dock, not just attached.
  - **Source-list context menu** — the dock's `sourceList` has no
    `CustomContextMenu` wired at all (only `sceneList` does), so right-click is dead.
    Add a context menu reaching parity with the main Sources tree: Edit Transform /
    reset / fit / center / flip, order, scale filtering, blending, deinterlacing,
    Filters, Properties, Rename, Remove. Most of this is tied to the main window's
    current scene today, so it shares 3a's parameterization work.
  - **Edit Transform** — numeric transform dialog wired to the dock's selected
    scene item (complements 3a's drag-to-transform in the preview).
  - **Scene-list context menu** — the dock's scene menu is only Add/Rename/Remove;
    the main Scenes menu adds Duplicate, copy/paste filters, order, Filters,
    Projector, Show in Multiview, etc. Bring to parity where it makes sense per
    canvas.
  Sequence after 3a (the editable preview is the foundation; the context menus and
  add-source reuse the same main-scene-decoupling).
- 🔭 **3e — Stats dock: multi-stream monitoring (needs design).** OBS's stock Stats
  dock reports a single output (the main stream/recording). With the encode-once
  fan-out engine, the user wants to monitor **all** outputs at once — per-binding
  bitrate / dropped frames / reconnects / CPU-GPU, grouped by canvas, plus the
  shared per-canvas encode stats. **Open design question (no approach yet):**
  whether to extend/replace the stock `OBSBasicStats` dock or build a new
  multistream-stats panel reading `MultistreamOutput`'s per-`obs_output` handles
  (it already tracks them); how to present N outputs compactly; and what libobs
  per-output stats (`obs_output_get_total_frames`/`_frames_dropped`/congestion) map
  cleanly per binding. Brainstorm before planning.

---

## Phase 4 — Frontend rewrite: CEF-hosted Svelte UI 🔧 MVP SHIPPED + CUTOVER

The new Svelte/CEF frontend is the default build (`USE_LEGACY_FRONTEND=OFF` at
cutover); it boots, previews, edits, and multistreams. Core parity + the UI
redesign + theme editor + global audio + scene/source persistence + source
filters + scene transitions + the medium parity gaps + low-priority items
(About, projectors, hotkeys) + the Stats dock are done. The frontend is
feature-complete for streaming/multistream; the remaining items are
deferred-by-choice (Studio Mode, undo/redo, recording, multiview, obs-websocket)
or verification owed (GUI acceptance + a live broadcast) — see "Remaining work".

Replace the Qt Widgets desktop frontend with a web UI (**Svelte**) hosted in
**CEF as the whole application shell**. libobs and the fork's native-multistream
engine (`CanvasManager` / `MultistreamOutput` / `OutputBinding`) stay; only the
UI layer changes.

**Why:** Qt Widgets' layout model is the flexibility ceiling — e.g. the preview
is the `QMainWindow` central widget and can't be hidden/reflowed (no
`display:none` equivalent; see 3c). A web UI removes that whole class of
constraint (CSS layout; freely hide/move/overlap panels), and on the chosen
criteria — lightweight, future-proof, scalable, reliable, flexible — beats the
alternatives.

**Stack decided (after a research pass; full rationale → forthcoming spec):**

- **Shell: CEF as the whole UI** — not Electron, Tauri, or QML. Reuses the
  `libcef` + obs-browser CEF integration already shipped for browser sources →
  one Chromium runtime for UI *and* sources; no second runtime, no Node, no
  native addon. Lowest incremental footprint; in-process C++↔libobs.
- **UI framework: Svelte** — compiled, no vDOM runtime; fits the real-time
  control-surface nature; Svelte 5 + Vercel backing = future-proof.
- **Preview: native-window (HWND/NSView) passthrough** — libobs renders its GPU
  surface into a host-owned window handle (the Streamlabs-proven mechanism;
  macOS via IOSurface).
- Rejected: Tauri (mandatory CEF cancels its lightness), Electron (two
  Chromiums), QML (single-vendor, smaller ecosystem), Sciter/Ultralight (second
  runtime), Flutter (Windows GPU embed broken / desktop archived), Slint (GPLv3
  + immature for desktop chrome).

**Make-or-break first step — de-risking spike (gate before committing): ✅ DONE
2026-06-21 — verdict GO.** A throwaway standalone CEF-host exe (`spike/cef-host/`,
gitignored) proved all four gate items: libobs boots and runs at a steady 60 fps
under the CEF message loop with **no Qt**; `obs_display` renders `monitor_capture`
into a child HWND alongside the embedded browser; a `CefMessageRouter` JS↔C++
round-trip returns the libobs version; clean warning-free teardown (a deferred-
destroy cascade race was fixed via single-ownership + a `while(obs_wait_for_
destroy_queue())` drain, mirroring `OBSBasic::ClearSceneData`), leak count a
constant static 3. Independently reproduced 4/4. Spec/plan/RESULTS:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-20-cef-host-spike*` + `spike/cef-host/
RESULTS.md` (all gitignored — read directly). The mechanism is proven; do not
re-spike it.

**⚠ Biggest 4.1 risk the spike re-scoped (NOT the mechanism):** the spike loaded
only a 2-module allowlist (`image-source`, `win-capture`) because
`obs_load_all_modules()` **aborts headless** — many plugins (encoders, services,
outputs, frontend-tools, *-output-ui) call into `obs-frontend-api` callbacks that
**only the Qt frontend currently installs**. Replacing Qt therefore requires a
**headless-safe `obs-frontend-api` shim** (or curated+patched module loading) to
run the full plugin set. This is unscoped, non-trivial, and plausibly the single
largest chunk of 4.1 — validate it with a cheap throwaway test BEFORE sinking 4.1
effort. Also: the full-app teardown must replicate `ClearSceneData`'s
enum-remove-all-then-drain, not the spike's single-scene minimal version.

**✅ De-risking spike 4.0b — headless `obs-frontend-api` shim — DONE 2026-06-21,
verdict GO.** A throwaway console exe (`spike/frontend-api/`, gitignored) registered
a non-Qt `HeadlessFrontendCallbacks : obs_frontend_callbacks` (all 95 methods —
mostly typed-zero stubs, ~10 real bodies: scene getter, 3 config getters, event/
save/preload registries with fan-out, locale passthrough) via
`obs_frontend_set_callbacks_internal()` before a curated module load. Result
(verified from `run.log`, exit 0): **19 plugins loaded** (incl. obs-x264,
obs-ffmpeg, obs-qsv11, rtmp-services, obs-outputs, obs-browser, obs-webrtc,
win-capture, win-dshow, win-wasapi, obs-filters/transitions), **all 4 functional
probes created OK** (`obs_x264` encoder, `rtmp_custom` service, `rtmp_output`
output, `browser_source`), clean teardown (`bnum_allocs()=3`). **Sized: only 2 of
95 callbacks were actually invoked at load** (`add_event_callback`, `on_event`) —
so the real 4.1 API-layer surface is small (~10–15 live bodies; the rest stay
typed-zero stubs until a UI feature needs them). **One real finding (the Qt-coupling
blocker we were watching for): `obs-websocket` hard-crashes at load**
(`STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN` → `QWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a
QWidget`) — Qt-coupled plugins need either a `QApplication -platform offscreen`
stood up before load, or exclusion. Denylist for 4.1 = `frontend-tools`,
`decklink-output-ui`, `decklink-captions`, `aja-output-ui`, **`obs-websocket`**
(until offscreen-QApplication or a native reimplementation). Spec/plan/RESULTS:
`docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-21-frontend-api-shim-spike*` +
`spike/frontend-api/RESULTS.md` (all gitignored — read directly). The headless
approach is proven; do not re-spike it.

**Scope note:** large multi-sub-project effort (the Qt frontend is ~85K LOC of
UI + app logic), decomposed into its own spec/plan cycles. Remaining Phase 3
items — **3b** (per-canvas Studio Mode) and **3e** (Stats dock) — and any further
canvas-editing parity are **deferred and rebuilt in the new frontend** rather
than written in throwaway Qt. 3a/3d (already shipped in Qt) inform the new
design but their widgets are superseded.

**Migration decided (Approach A — parallel big-bang):** move the current Qt
frontend to `frontend_old/` (kept for reference/parity-checking, not the active
build), build the new Svelte/CEF frontend fresh in `frontend/`, flip the default
at cutover (4.6). A CMake flag (e.g. `USE_LEGACY_FRONTEND`, default ON until the
new frontend reaches MVP) keeps `frontend_old` buildable through the transition
so a working app is always available; only one frontend ever builds at a time.

### Build progress — DONE ✅

Spikes + the full build pipeline + UI redesign + post-redesign features, all
build-green, headless-smoke clean (leaks 2 baseline), and pushed.

- ✅ **4.0 / 4.0b spikes** (GO) — CEF-as-shell + libobs-in-process proven; headless
  non-Qt `obs_frontend_callbacks` shim proven (curated module load; `obs-websocket`
  + other Qt-coupled plugins denylisted pending offscreen-QApplication).
- ✅ **4.1 — shell + bridge + frontend-api layer** — migration scaffold
  (`frontend`→`frontend_old`, `USE_LEGACY_FRONTEND` flag); CEF UI exe serving an
  offline `app://` bundle; single-`CefInitialize` obs-browser coexistence
  (`modbender/obs-browser` fork, env-gated CEF-deferral patch); 20-plugin curated
  load via the non-Qt shim; typed JS↔C++ bridge (`window.obs.call`/`.on` + event
  push); Svelte 5 + Vite + TS shell (bun-built, offline).
- ✅ **4.2 — preview embedding** — UI-positioned native `obs_display` child-HWND
  overlay z-ordered above CEF, per-canvas surfaces keyed `(windowId, canvasUuid)`,
  letterbox + drag/select/stretch/crop editing, multi-surface isolation.
- ✅ **4.3 — core parity + properties** — Scenes / Sources / Preview docks on the
  global channel-0 path; generic `obs_properties` renderer (most types); Add-Source
  type picker; source defaults fixed (descriptor-built, default-aware values).
- ✅ **4.4 — multistream UI** — per-canvas composite `CanvasDock` (preview + scenes
  + sources, output-gated reconciler), Multistream dock (per-output status, toggles),
  Settings tabs Canvas / Streams / Outputs over the existing native engine.
- ✅ **UI redesign (locked design spec, mocks-as-acceptance) P1–P5** —
  P1 shell + token theming (4 axes, 0-radius); P2 core docks on Dockview; P3 canvas
  composites + reconciler + floating tear-out (host-driven detach/redock, per-window
  preview surfaces); P4 Audio Mixer (faders + live dB meters); **P5 cutover**
  (`USE_LEGACY_FRONTEND=OFF`). Layout + theme persisted (`layout.json`/`theme.json`).
- ✅ **Post-redesign features** —
  right-click context menus on scene/source/canvas rows (+ `sources.rename`,
  `scenes.duplicate`); right-click in the native preview overlay (`WM_RBUTTONUP` →
  `preview.contextMenu` → DOM menu over a suspended overlay); theme editor (edit
  every token + custom-theme save/delete, live + persisted, opaque JSON blob);
  **global audio device management** (seed Desktop Audio + Mic on first run, persisted
  to `audio_devices.json`, Settings → Audio device pickers — fixes the empty mixer,
  verified against a real device).

### Remaining work 🔭 (priority order)

**High — core usability gaps:**

- ✅ **Scene / source persistence (global / Default canvas) — DONE 2026-06-23.**
  `scene_collection.json` save/load via `obs_save_sources_filtered` + `obs_load_sources`
  (round-trips scenes WITH full item layout). Loads on boot (placeholder fallback when
  absent); saves on every global scene/source mutation, on drag-end, and on clean exit.
  Excludes the channel 1-6 global-audio sources (restored from `audio_devices.json`) and
  additional-canvas-scoped sources. Note: Default/global scenes live on libobs's
  `main_canvas`, so the filter keeps `canvas == obs_get_main_canvas()` + null-canvas
  inputs, drops additional-canvas scenes. Round-trip + `leaks: 2` verified. **Follow-ups:**
  per-canvas scene persistence (additional canvases still rebuild empty); audio
  volume/mute persistence (only the device persists today). Multiple named scene
  collections — **done in Phase 6a.**
- ✅ **Source filters — DONE 2026-06-24.** `filterTypes.list` + `filters.list/add/
  remove/setEnabled/reorder/rename` + a `"filter"` property kind (resolve a filter by
  uuid → reuse the generic `obs_properties` renderer). Filters dialog (list + add
  type-picker + reorder/enable/remove/rename, with the selected filter's properties via
  `PropertyForm kind=filter`) reachable from the Sources / Canvas / preview source
  context menus AND the audio-mixer rows (mic noise suppression). Filters persist
  automatically with their parent source via the scene collection. Dup default names
  auto-suffix. **Follow-up:** in-dialog live preview (the dialog suspends the overlay
  while open, so effects show in the main preview after closing, not live in-dialog).
- ✅ **Scene transitions — DONE 2026-06-24.** Channel 0 now holds an active
  transition source (Fade by default, 300 ms) wrapping the current scene; a
  `Transitions::GetProgramScene()`/`SetProgramScene()` seam unwraps it at every
  channel-0 read/write (scenes.list current flag, preview surface, scene-save,
  setCurrent → `obs_transition_start`, remove-fallback). Type + duration persist to
  `transitions.json` (excluded from the scene collection, like global audio);
  re-sized on `obs_reset_video`; duration clamped to 20 s. Bridge `transitionTypes.list`
  + `transitions.getCurrent/setCurrent/setDuration`; real TransitionsDock (type
  dropdown + duration ms). Default/global program path only; additional-canvas
  switches stay direct (→ 3b). Holistic review = SHIP; build clean, smoke green
  (unwrap returns the scene name not "Fade", leaks 2). **GUI-owed:** the visual fade
  animation (headless-undriveable). **Follow-up:** transition-source properties
  (Fade-to-Color / Luma Wipe / Stinger) use defaults — no properties UI yet;
  per-canvas transitions (→ 3b).
- ⏸ **Studio Mode (3b) — DEFERRED (decided 2026-06-25).** Preview/program staging +
  transition, per canvas. Menu item stays disabled. Deferred as low-value for this
  fork's use case (it's a live-switching-production workflow); revisit if that need
  arises. Transitions already cover the global program path; Studio Mode would add an
  off-air preview scene + a program surface + the preview→program transition action.
- ✅ **Stats dock (3e) — DONE 2026-06-25.** `stats.get` bridge + `MultistreamEngine::
  StatsSnapshot()` (per-live-output counters under `liveMutex`). A Stats dock (opened on
  demand via the Docks/View menu) polls ~1×/s: general perf grid (CPU/memory/FPS/avg
  frame time/render-lag/encoder-skip, warn-colored over threshold) + per-output rows
  (state dot, profile→canvas, bitrate via byte-delta cache, dropped+%, congestion,
  duration). Build-clean /W4 /WX, selftest verifies the shape, `leaks: 2`. Per-output
  live numbers (bitrate/drops) need a real broadcast to verify (GUI/live-owed).
- ✅ **Scene linking (non-default canvas ↔ main-scene activation sync) — IMPLEMENTED
  (build-green + per-task & holistic review; GUI acceptance owed) 2026-06-27.** A
  non-default canvas scene can *follow* one or more Default (main) scenes: switching
  the program scene auto-switches every linked canvas to its mapped scene (activation
  sync, not content mirror; names need not match). Right-click a canvas-dock scene →
  "Link to ▸" checkable submenu of main scenes; linked rows show a 🔗 badge + tooltip.
  The pre-existing `CanvasSceneLink` type (uuid-keyed → rename-robust) is now wired
  end-to-end: new `SceneLinkStore` persists per scene-collection to
  `scenes/<slug>.scene_links.json` (mirrors `OutputBindingStore`);
  `ObsBootstrap::ApplyCanvasSceneLinks` + 3 prune helpers; bridge
  `sceneLink.list/set/clear` + `sceneLink.changed`; hooks on program-scene switch
  (apply), scene/canvas/canvas-scene delete (prune), and collection-switch + boot
  (re-apply the restored program scene's links). `ContextMenu` gained one-level
  checkable flyout submenus (shared component; flat menus unchanged). Spec/plan:
  `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/2026-06-27-scene-linking*` (gitignored). Subagent-driven
  exec, per-task spec+quality reviews + a holistic final review = SHIP_WITH_MINOR (the
  one Important finding — links not re-applied on boot/collection-switch — was fixed).
  **GUI-owed** (headless-undriveable): toggle link/unlink + 🔗 indicator, activation
  sync on a real switch, persistence across restart, prune on delete. **Known
  invariant** (documented in the spec): activation sync is hooked only on the bridge
  program-scene-switch path — there is no scene-switch hotkey in this frontend today,
  so a future such hotkey must also call `ApplyCanvasSceneLinks`.

**Medium — parity gaps:**

- ✅ **File-dialog / Browse — DONE 2026-06-24.** Native `dialog.openFile` bridge
  method (modern `IFileDialog` COM — open/save/directory, OBS filter-string parsing,
  parented to the main host window, COM-balance/leak-reviewed = SHIP); `PathControl`'s
  Browse button wired. File-based sources can now pick paths.
- ✅ **Property types font / editable_list / frame_rate — DONE 2026-06-24.** Replaced
  the "Editing not yet supported" fallback with real controls (FontControl
  face/size/bold-italic-underline-strikeout; EditableListControl add/remove/reorder +
  Add Files via the dialog; FrameRateControl common-rate dropdown + numerator/
  denominator). Serializer enriched with editable_list (type/filter/default_path) +
  frame_rate (fps_options/fps_ranges) metadata; the generic obs_data JSON write path
  round-trips the values. Registered in the data-driven control registry.
- ✅ **Edit → Transform — DONE 2026-06-24.** `sceneItems.getTransform/setTransform/
  transformAction` (position/scale/rotation/crop/alignment/bounding-box + reset/center/
  fit/stretch/flip; per-canvas base res; round-trip + center math runtime-verified in
  the boot self-test). Numeric Transform dialog reachable from the Sources/Canvas/
  Preview source context menus + the Edit→Transform menu item.
- ⏸ **Undo / Redo — DEFERRED (decided 2026-06-24).** No undo infrastructure exists;
  it's a from-scratch cross-cutting subsystem (every mutation needs paired undo/redo
  actions + an action stack), not a quick parity fix. Tackle as its own planned effort
  later (after Studio Mode / Stats). Edit→Undo/Redo stay disabled until then.
- ⏸ **Recording / Replay buffer — KEPT DORMANT (decided 2026-06-24).** The app stays
  streaming-only; recording remains hidden/inert (no bridge). Revisit only if the need
  arises.

**Low / likely out of scope (confirm):**

- ✅ **About dialog — DONE 2026-06-24.** Help→About modal (product name, tagline,
  libobs version, GPLv2+, fork note); offline.
- ✅ **Projectors + Fullscreen Preview — DONE 2026-06-24.** Native `ProjectorManager`
  + borderless-fullscreen / windowed projector windows rendering a target
  (program/scene/source/canvas) into their own `obs_display`, letterboxed, closing on
  Esc/window-close; teardown ordered before canvas mixes. `display.listMonitors` +
  `projector.open/close/list`; per-monitor + windowed entries in the Sources/Scenes/
  Preview/Canvas context menus + the View menu (program). Selftest + monitor-enum
  verified; on-screen rendering/fullscreen placement is GUI-owed. (Fullscreen Preview =
  a program projector.) Recordings list is moot — recording is dormant.
- 🔭 **Multiview** — a grid render of all scenes in one window. Larger: needs a custom
  multi-scene grid render (not a single `obs_display` of one target like projectors).
  Own scoping pass before building.
- ✅ **Hotkeys settings — DONE 2026-06-24.** Enumerate libobs hotkeys, bind key combos,
  persist (`hotkeys.json`, keyed by name), restore on boot. `hotkeys.list/set/clear`
  (UI sends DOM `KeyboardEvent.code` + modifiers → a data-table maps to `obs_key`);
  Start/Stop Streaming frontend hotkeys registered + wired to the engine. **Bound
  hotkeys fire globally** via libobs's existing `GetAsyncKeyState` poll thread (verified
  against source — no keyboard hook needed). Hotkeys tab in Settings (grouped by
  registerer, click-to-capture + clear + filter). Selftest round-trips a binding;
  real-keypress firing is GUI-owed.
- 🔭 **obs-websocket** — excluded (Qt-coupled, hard-crashes headless). Needs an
  offscreen-`QApplication` stood up before load, or a native reimplementation, if
  remote control is wanted. (Note: Phase 5 OBS-MCP would give AI control via the
  bridge instead — may reduce the need for obs-websocket.)

**Cleanup / infra:**

- 🔭 **`frontend_old` retirement** — the new build still references `frontend_old/api`
  + the utility model `.cpp`s (`CanvasDefinition`/`OBSCanvas`/`CanvasSceneLink`/
  `OutputBinding`/`StreamProfile`, see `frontend/CMakeLists.txt`) + the cpack license.
  Relocate those into `frontend/`, then delete the old Qt tree.
- 🔭 **Cross-platform preview** — Windows-only today (HWND + D3D11). macOS
  (NSView + IOSurface) and Linux (X11/GL) embedding are later efforts.
- 🔧 **Live broadcast test** (owed since Phase 2) + **GUI acceptance** of the recent
  menu / theme / preview / audio work (none driveable headlessly).
- ⏸ Minor: `SettingsModal.load()` routes device-fetch errors to the `videoError`
  label (cosmetic).

## Phase 5 — OBS MCP: AI control surface 🔧 MVP SHIPPED (2026-06-25)

Expose the app's OBS control to AI agents over the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**,
so an assistant can drive the production — switch scenes, add/configure sources, edit
transforms, manage canvases / stream profiles / output bindings, start/stop the
multistream, and read live state — through a typed, discoverable tool surface.

**MVP DONE (embedded HTTP, decided topology):** an embedded localhost HTTP MCP server
(`frontend/src/mcp/{HttpServer,McpServer}`), opt-in (`mcp.json enabled=false` default,
nothing listens until turned on), token-auth, `127.0.0.1`-only. Speaks the MCP
request/response subset (`initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call`/`ping`); every
`tools/call` marshals onto the CEF UI thread (15s-timeout future, shutdown-guarded) and
reuses the existing `Bridge::Dispatch` over `g_methods`. **20 curated tools**
(list/switch/create scene, scene-item visibility+transform, source create/rename/remove,
transitions, canvas/profile/output lists, multistream status + start/stop, get_stats)
+ a generic **`obs_call`** escape hatch. **Capability gating:** Read always; Mutate
(`allowMutations`); GoLive (`allowGoLive`, default off) — start/stop_output are GoLive.
A Settings **"AI Control"** tab (enable, port, copyable endpoint + token, regenerate,
the two capability toggles). Self-test round-trips initialize/tools.list/curated +
generic calls + go-live gating; `leaks: 2`, clean thread join at teardown. **Owed:**
a real external MCP client (Claude Desktop/Code) driving OBS over the socket end-to-end
(GUI/live; the self-test proves the protocol in-process). Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-25-phase5-obs-mcp-design.md` (gitignored).

**Later (post-MVP):** SSE / server-initiated notifications (push obs events as MCP
notifications), MCP **resources** (scenes/canvas/stats as pull resources), per-tool
confirmations, schema auto-generation from an annotated `g_methods`, remote/auth
hardening.

**Why this is cheap to build here:** the CEF bridge is already a **data-driven method
registry** (~77 operations in `g_methods`: `scenes.*`, `sources.*`, `properties.*`,
`filters.*`, `transitions.*`, `sceneItems.*` incl. transform, `audio.*`, `canvas.*`,
`streams.*`, `outputBindings.*`, `multistream.*`, `dialog.*`, `window.*`). MCP tools map
almost 1:1 onto these. The work is a transport + schema-generation layer over the
existing registry, **not** a reimplementation of OBS control — the same envelope
(`{method, params} -> result`) that `window.obs.call` uses is what an MCP tool would
invoke. Events (`EmitEvent`) can surface as MCP notifications/resources for live state.

**Open design questions (resolve before building):**

- **Topology** — (a) MCP server *embedded in the app process* exposing `g_methods`
  directly over stdio/HTTP, vs (b) a *sidecar* process that relays to the app. (a)
  reuses the in-process registry with zero IPC and is the natural fit; (b) decouples
  lifecycle but needs a wire protocol (and `obs-websocket` is excluded here, Qt-coupled).
  Lean (a).
- **Schema generation** — derive each MCP tool's input schema from the bridge method's
  params. Either hand-author a manifest, or (better, DRY) annotate `g_methods` entries
  with a param schema and generate the MCP tool list from the same registry that drives
  `window.obs.call` — one source of truth.
- **Tool granularity** — one MCP tool per bridge method (discoverable, large list) vs a
  few coarse tools (`obs.call` passthrough + a `list_methods`). Probably a curated set of
  high-value tools (scene/source/stream control) plus a generic escape hatch.
- **State exposure** — scenes/sources/canvas/stream status as MCP *resources* (pull) and
  the existing push events as *notifications*, so an agent can observe, not just act.
- **Safety / gating** — local-only by default; if remote, auth + a capability split
  (read-only vs mutating vs streaming-control); confirmations for irreversible/outward
  actions (go-live). Mirror the app's own "outward actions need confirmation" posture.

**Scope note:** new sub-spec/plan cycle when Phase 4 is wrapped. Build on the *existing*
bridge registry; do not fork a second control path. This is additive (a new interface to
the same engine), independent of the remaining Phase-4 UI items.

---

## Phase 6 — Multiple scene collections + OBS Studio importer

Two parts: **6a** multiple named scene collections (OBS-parity the Phase-4 rewrite
dropped — and the prerequisite for the importer), then **6b** a read-only importer
that pulls a real OBS Studio install's config into this fork.

### Phase 6a — Multiple scene collections ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-26)

Add multiple named scene collections (list / create / rename / delete / switch,
persisted, surviving restart). **Merged to `master` (fast-forward, tip `75a73e8ac`);
`scene-collections` branch deleted.**

**Architecture:** scene collections are a **frontend** feature — libobs has *zero*
scene-collection concept (verified: 0 references in `libobs/`; the engine only offers
`obs_save_sources`/`obs_load_sources`). OBS's old Qt frontend owned it; the Phase-4
rewrite simply never reimplemented it. Built in the C++ bridge (`frontend/src/`), NOT
libobs.

**Model (locked):** *per-collection* = scenes/sources (main-canvas scenes + plain
inputs, the set `scene_persistence` already captures) **+ output bindings** (each show
routes to its own destinations). *Global, shared* = canvases (reusable encode targets)
and stream profiles (credentials never re-entered per show).

- ✅ **Registry + per-collection persistence + migration** — `scene_collections.
  {cpp,hpp}` (`{id,name,sceneFile}` index in `basic/scene_collections.json`, slugged
  `scenes/<slug>.json` per collection); `scene_persistence` generalized to path-based
  Save/Load + `ClearCurrent` (reuses the *same* `SaveFilter` as Save, so the
  save/teardown boundary can't drift). First-run migration points the existing
  `scene_collection.json` + `output_bindings.json` at the first "Untitled" collection
  (in-place, zero data loss).
- ✅ **Switch mechanism** — `Switch(id)` = save outgoing scenes+bindings → teardown
  drain (the proven shutdown drain: unbind ch0 transition → enum+remove → wait for
  destroy queue) → flip+persist index → load incoming scenes+bindings → re-establish
  the ch0 transition → emit `collections/scenes/transitions/outputBinding/multistream
  .changed`. **Refuses while live** (`Multistream().AnyLive()`, before any mutation);
  `Remove(active)` switches away first. Corrupt-index hardening: mutating bridge ops
  refuse when both index `.json` + `.bak` are unparseable (won't clobber on-disk
  scene files); reads still work.
- ✅ **Per-collection output bindings** — `OutputBindingStore` made path-based;
  bindings travel with the active collection (sibling `scenes/<slug>.output_bindings
  .json`); migrated from the legacy global file; zero-binding new collection doesn't
  crash (Default canvas keeps its central preview placeholder).
- ✅ **Switcher UI** — a "Scene Collection ▾" menu-bar dropdown (active radio-checked
  → switch; New… / Rename… / Delete via a reused zero-radius `CollectionDialog`;
  Delete disabled at the last collection; refresh on `collections.changed`); backend
  errors (switch-while-live, delete-last, dup-name) surfaced, not swallowed.

Subagent-driven (4 tasks + per-task reviews + a holistic review = SHIP_WITH_MINOR, all
addressed). Build green /W4 /WX, `bun run check` 0/0, smoke `leaks: 2`. **GUI/runtime
acceptance owed** (headless-undriveable): the switch round-trip (create B → switch →
add scenes → back to A intact → B's scenes present), leak-hygiene across
boot→switch→switch→shutdown, and the while-live / corrupt-index rejection paths.

**Scope boundary (intentional):** only *main-canvas* scenes are per-collection;
additional-canvas scenes remain global (the pre-existing per-canvas-persistence gap,
unchanged). Output bindings *are* per-collection.

### Phase 6b — OBS Studio data importer ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-28 (as Phase-7 backlog Item 17)

A read-only importer: detect a real OBS Studio install (`%APPDATA%/obs-studio`) and
recreate its data inside this fork (`%APPDATA%/obs-multistream`), **never modifying the
original OBS data**. Built on the 6a multi-collection foundation.

> **Shipped on `ui-redesign`** (backend `3738f09a0` `frontend/src/obs_importer.{cpp,hpp}`
> + `importer.scan`/`import`; wizard `642f237db` `ImporterDialog.svelte` in Settings →
> General → Importer). Read-only invariant audited clean (every obs-studio access is
> `obs_data_create_from_json_file` / `config_open(...EXISTING)`; writes only to fork dirs).
> Per-collection **and** per-scene selection with dependency closure; service / video /
> audio mapped from the **active per-profile** dir (`user.ini` → `ProfileDir`); live-guard
> + dedup. Open decision: active-profile-only (a profile picker is an optional follow-up).
> A real scan/import round-trip is GUI-owed.

**Design decisions (locked with the user 2026-06-26, as built):**

**Decisions (locked with the user 2026-06-26):**
- **Scope: everything** — scene collections, stream destinations (service + keys),
  video settings, audio settings.
- **A selective wizard window** — a dedicated CEF dialog that lets the user toggle
  *what* to import, down to **per-collection and per-scene** granularity (pick a whole
  collection or a single scene out of it), plus per-profile toggles for
  Destination / Video / Audio.
- **Leave destinations unwired** — import collections, canvases, and stream profiles as
  independent pieces; the user wires destinations→canvases (output bindings) afterward.
  Honest to OBS's model (OBS has no per-collection binding concept).
- **Launch from the File menu** — "Import from OBS Studio…" (explicit, re-runnable).

**Mapping (from the 6b research pass — accurate field-level map exists):**
- **OBS scene collection → fork scene collection** *(strong — libobs-native)*: OBS
  `basic/scenes/*.json` is the *same* serialization the fork loads; its `sources` array
  feeds `obs_load_sources` verbatim (filters/transforms/groups for free). OBS has **no
  index** — scan the dir, read the display name from each file's `"name"` key, exclude
  `.bak`. **Per-scene import** = parse the `sources` array, take the selected scenes +
  their **dependency closure** (referenced inputs + nested scenes/groups), write a fork
  collection with that filtered array (the one genuinely new piece of logic).
- **`service.json` → stream profile** *(strong, near 1:1)*: OBS `"type"` → fork
  `serviceId`; `"settings"` blob passed verbatim; profile name → label.
- **`basic.ini` `[Video]` → canvas** *(strong)*: `BaseCX/CY`/`OutputCX/CY` + the
  `FPSType/FPSCommon/FPSInt/FPSNum/FPSDen` encoding (NTSC fractions table known) →
  CanvasDefinition (Default canvas updated; extra profiles → additional canvases).
  Decision pending: `OutputCX/CY` (encode size) vs `BaseCX/CY` when OBS downscales.
- **`basic.ini` `[Audio]` → global audio** *(strong)*: `SampleRate` + `ChannelSetup`
  (lowercase the value) → `settings.setAudio`.

**Caveats (carry into the spec):** global audio *channels* embedded as top-level keys
in OBS scene JSON are dropped by the fork's loader (separate import step if wanted);
encoder id is split between `basic.ini [AdvOut]` and `streamEncoder.json` (read both);
Simple-output mode infers the encoder from `[SimpleOutput]`; the dup-profile guard
(key/name) means re-import must skip or rename; missing-plugin sources are skipped with
a warning by `obs_load_sources`; "OBS not found" must fail gracefully (hence the Browse
fallback). Full research + the field-by-field map live in the session transcript /
forthcoming 6b spec.

**Next step when resumed:** finalize the wizard mock (the per-profile-vs-global
Video/Audio toggle shape was the open UI question) → spec → plan → subagent-driven
build (C++ scan/apply bridge methods via super-languages; the wizard via super-frontend).
Reuses the libobs load path + the three-layer canvas/profile/binding model; do not
invent a parallel persistence format.

## Phase 7 — Full UI redesign: nav-rail multi-page app 🔧 FEATURE-COMPLETE (GUI acceptance + merge owed)

> All six phases (7.0–7.5) built + reviewed on `ui-redesign` (final holistic = SHIP_WITH_MINOR); pushed, **not merged** — held for the user's GUI acceptance pass. Two behavior changes to confirm: existing users must **Reset Layout** once to see the studio reorg (a saved `layout.json` restores the old arrangement); **Settings now live-applies with no Cancel/undo** (the modal's transactional revert, incl. the issues.md-C1 output-binding revert, was intentionally dropped for the page model).


A ground-up reconception of the frontend IA, driven by a Claude Design mock the user
authored ("OBS fork multistream redesign"). Rationale: the prior UI (incl. the Phase-4
rewrite + settings redesign) was an *enhancement of OBS's original layout*; the fork's
real goal is **more control + multistream**, so the UI is rebuilt around that. The mock
is the acceptance criterion ("mock IS the spec"); it's an intentionally incomplete
reference — menu-bar items are rehomed by us. Reference + analysis (gitignored):
`docs/superpowers/design-redesign/{OBS-MultiStream.dc.html.json,ANALYSIS.md}`. Branch
`ui-redesign`.

**The shift:** from a top **menu bar + single Dockview workspace + modal Settings** →
a **70px left icon nav rail** switching **six full-page views**: Studio · Stream
(Destinations) · Schedule · Monitor (Stats) · AI · Settings.

**Tokens:** Geist + Geist Mono, the mock's dark palette (bg `#0a0a0b`, accent amber
`#e7a338`), zero border-radius; axes theme dark|light, accent (amber/blue/violet/
emerald/rose), density (comfortable|compact).

**Decisions locked (2026-06-26):** (A) **Schedule = UI shell only** this rewrite
(calendar + New-Stream modal on local state; persistence + auto-go-live later). (B)
**Orphan menu items → nav-rail footer** (Scene Collection switcher + About) **+ Studio
"⋯" overflow** (projector launchers); transforms/filters/projectors stay in context
menus. (C) **Appearance = keep the full per-token theme editor AND add presets**
(accent swatches + light/dark + density). (D) **Docking = keep Dockview, restyle** (not
the mock's bespoke float/dock system); Studio is a re-skin + re-IA.

**Phasing (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-26-phase7-shell.md`):**

- ✅ **7.0 — Tokens + nav-rail shell + view router — SHIPPED** (commits `a312a0c` tokens,
  `5bddaa061` nav-rail+router, `c71a2e39d` studio page; holistic review = SHIP, pushed to
  `origin/ui-redesign`, not merged). Studio Dark default palette + Geist offline +
  accent/mode axes (theme editor kept); 70px NavRail (6 views + footer scene-collection
  switcher + About) replacing the menu bar (MenuBar kept, unrendered); page router;
  `StudioPage` (DockHost lifecycle a verbatim move, kept mounted + `display:none`, not
  `{#if}`); CANVASES chip bar (eye-toggle ↔ Dockview show/hide, restore chips, Reset
  Layout) + bottom GO-LIVE bar (live state + per-binding start/stop + stats perfRow, all
  real bridge data); explicit `suspendPreview()` overlay gate hiding the native preview +
  CanvasDock off-Studio. `bun run check` 0/0, build green, smoke `leaks: 2`. **All visual
  fidelity GUI-owed.** Subagent-driven; caught + fixed a Critical `--accent` CSS-var
  collision in review.
- 🔧 **7.1 — Studio reorg.** Preview-row over bottom-docks-row layout, Dockview restyle to
  the mock's dock chrome (headers w/ float/close, tokens, zero-radius), embedded
  scenes/sources in additional-canvas docks, full CANVASES-bar + GO-LIVE-bar fidelity.
  Carry-ins from 7.0: gate the stats poll on `page==='studio'`; focused-canvas (not
  all-outputs) live state; persistent per-canvas hide; a real add-canvas flow (`+`
  currently routes to Settings).
- 🔭 **7.2 — Stream + Monitor + AI pages.** Re-IA the MultistreamDock / StatsDock /
  McpTab content into full pages.
- 🔭 **7.3 — Settings page + Appearance.** Full page w/ 196px left sub-nav (Canvases /
  Stream Profiles / Outputs / Audio / Hotkeys / Appearance); Appearance hosts the accent/
  mode/density presets + the existing per-token theme editor (re-exposes the Theme Editor,
  which is unreachable in the 7.0–7.2 interim — theme still applies).
- 🔭 **7.4 — Schedule (UI shell).** Calendar grid + Upcoming + New-Stream modal on local
  state (no backend per Decision A).
- 🔭 **7.5 — Orphan homes + polish + holistic review.** Studio "⋯" overflow (projectors),
  remaining Edit/View/Docks menu actions, final fidelity pass, then merge to `master`.

> **Update:** 7.1–7.5 all SHIPPED to `origin/ui-redesign` (commits 7.2 `06a0bd8b4`, 7.3
> `52d6654ae`, 7.4 `06036fb1d`, 7.5 `7893013`, cleanup `b68467213`) + a GUI-acceptance fix
> batch (2026-06-27). Still not merged (GUI acceptance owed).

### OBS-parity backlog (Items 0–17) ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-28

After the redesign, an autonomous backlog closed the OBS feature-parity the CEF rewrite had
dropped. Items 0–17 (control doc gitignored) shipped on `ui-redesign`; the C++↔JS bridge grew
to **140 methods**. Each item = backend + frontend waves with per-task and a final holistic
review (SHIP_WITH_FIXES → all fixed; tip `0b4f22e2e`).

- **0** scale-filter + scene-collection duplicate. **1** Undo/Redo (`UndoManager`, `undo.*`,
  Ctrl+Z/Y, apply-target-state keyed on source uuid, add/remove snapshot-recreate). **2**
  source-type picker + add-source. **3** Advanced Audio Properties dialog (vol dB / mono /
  balance / sync offset / tracks / monitoring). **4** Virtual Camera (`VirtualCamManager`).
  **5** source Interact window. **6** canvas output-resolution / downscale / fractional FPS.
  **7** General settings (snapping, projectors, tray, multiview, importer prefs — descriptor
  table) + list search + scenes grid. **8** Advanced settings (process priority, stream
  delay, reconnect, bind-IP, etc. — descriptor table). **10** Multiview projector. **11**
  system tray. **12** browser / custom docks (iframe-based, bridge-persisted). **13** F11
  fullscreen + scenes grid mode. **14** source extras — missing-file relink, per-source
  deinterlacing, scene-item color tag + row tint. **15** screenshot (program + per-source,
  WIC PNG, `%APPDATA%/obs-multistream/screenshots/`, Ctrl+Shift+S, toast). **16** session log
  writer + Log Viewer + `shell.revealPath`/Open Folder. **17** = **Phase 6b** OBS-Studio
  importer, read-only (see below).

- ⏸ **Item 9 DEFERRED** — per-binding output overrides (stream delay/reconnect/bind-IP per
  output) conflict with the encode-once fan-out architecture; revisit as its own design
  effort. Also still deferred: per-canvas **Studio Mode** (Phase 3 3b), **Auto-Config
  wizard**, and three visual redesigns (Canvas modal, Appearance tab, Stream tiles).

- **GUI acceptance owed** for the whole backlog (headless can't drive the bridge): undo/redo,
  virtual cam, interact, screenshots + PNG correctness, deinterlace/color round-trips,
  missing-file relink, log viewer, and especially a real importer scan/import round-trip.

### Nav IA restructure + single Go Live ✅ 2026-06-28

The redesigned nav was reorganized so the three-layer model gets first-class homes, and all
live control collapsed to one button (spec/plan under `docs/superpowers/`). On `ui-redesign`,
frontend-only (backend already had `streaming.start`/`stop` = StartAllEnabled/StopAll).

- Nav rail: Studio · **Canvases** · **Streams** · Schedule · Monitor · AI · Settings (was
  "Stream"/Destinations). **Canvases** = master-detail page (left canvas list; right =
  `CanvasEditor` extracted from the old Settings→Canvases tab + that canvas's destinations as
  **toggle-only** rows with read-only live status). **Streams** = the promoted Stream Profiles
  manager. Settings dropped both tabs (now General/Audio/Hotkeys/Browser Docks/Appearance/
  Advanced).
- **Single source of truth for live:** one Go Live button in the Studio bar →
  `streaming.start`/`stop`; live state from the global `streaming.changed`. Removed ALL
  per-canvas/per-binding/per-stream start/stop (Studio per-focused loop, Stream page
  Start/Stop/Retry, Multistream dock Start — now a read-only monitor). Toggles
  (`outputBinding.setEnabled`) only arm; the canvas renders when ≥1 enabled binding.
- 5 tasks subagent-driven (super-frontend) + holistic review (super-quality = SHIP, 0
  Critical/0 Important; 3 Minors fixed). Deleted dead `StreamPage.svelte` + `CanvasesTab.svelte`.
  Commits `41ef6a6d0`..`2666ced4a`. check 0/0, build EXIT=0, leaks 2. **GUI acceptance owed:**
  nav switch, canvas edit + destination-toggle persistence, single Go Live starts/stops all.

## Phase 8 — Platform integration: OAuth + stream metadata + Go Live modal 🚧 MVP (8a–8e) DONE; 8f deferred

**Goal:** A "Stream Information" modal that opens when the single **Go Live** button is clicked
(classic-OBS style), letting the user set per-destination **title / category / tags / thumbnail**
and push them to the platform via its API before the stream starts. Platforms: **Twitch, Kick,
YouTube** (minimal metadata). OAuth is the enabler — not for streaming itself (RTMP stream keys
already work), but for editing live metadata the way stock OBS does.

**Why OAuth, not just stream keys:** streaming works today via RTMP keys. OAuth adds *managing*
the broadcast — title, game/category, tags, thumbnail — from inside the app.

**Core requirement — extensibility (a provider registry, not per-platform branching).** Adding a
new provider must be ~one module + one registry line, with the modal and engine untouched. This
is a data/registry design, not a `switch (platform)`:

- **`StreamProvider` interface** (C++ bridge) per platform: `id`, `displayName`, an **auth
  strategy** reference, `authConfig` (endpoints/scopes/cred-env-var names), a **capability
  descriptor** (which fields it supports + their constraints), `searchCategories(token, query)`,
  `applyMetadata(token, profile, fields)`, and optional broadcast-lifecycle hooks
  (create/bind/transition) for providers that need them (YouTube, Facebook).
- **`ProviderRegistry`** = `map<id, StreamProvider>` populated at boot. Bridge methods are
  generic and dispatch through it: `oauth.providers` (returns every provider's capability schema
  as JSON), `oauth.connect{providerId}` / `disconnect` / `status`, `streamMeta.searchCategories`,
  `streamMeta.get`/`set{profile, fields}`.
- **Auth strategies are a small reusable set** providers pick from — a new provider almost always
  reuses one rather than writing flow code: `device-code` · `pkce-loopback` · `auth-code+secret`
  (loopback or embedded webview) · (optional `proxy` for secret-required providers). Secret
  handling is a strategy concern (embed-obfuscated vs proxy), not per-provider code.
- **Capability-driven modal:** the Svelte Go Live modal renders fields *from* each connected
  destination's capability descriptor (title/category/tags/thumbnail/privacy/description as
  data). A new thumbnail-capable provider → the thumbnail field appears automatically; one
  without → hidden. **No modal edits to add a provider.**
- **Net:** adding a provider = a new `XProvider` (declares endpoints/scopes/caps + apply impl,
  reuses an auth strategy) + one registry entry + `X_CLIENTID`/`X_SECRET` env vars. Zero changes
  to the modal, the engine, or the other providers.

### Researched platform reality (2026-06-28; sources in the design analysis)

| | Title | Category | Tags | Thumbnail | Desktop auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Twitch** | ✓ | ✓ game_id | ✓ ≤10, lowercase-alnum-25 | ✗ (no API) | **Device Code Flow**, no secret | `PATCH /helix/channels` (one call). 4 h token; refresh one-time-use, 30-day inactivity expiry. |
| **Kick** | ✓ | ✓ category_id | ✓ ≤10 | ✗ (read-only field) | Auth-code **+ PKCE but secret STILL required**; no device flow | `PATCH /public/v1/channels` (one call). Official API exists (`api.kick.com`). Youngest API. |
| **YouTube** | ✓ | ✓ (on the video, separate call) | ✓ | ✓ `thumbnails.set` (2 MB, phone-verified acct) | **PKCE loopback** (Desktop client) or device flow, no secret | Full broadcast lifecycle: create→bind→set meta→thumbnail→transition. **Sensitive scope ⇒ Google app verification; 100-user cap until verified (weeks).** Quota fine. |

Key asymmetry: **Twitch/Kick = one PATCH**; **YouTube = a whole broadcast-lifecycle integration**.
**Thumbnail support: YouTube ✓, Facebook ✓, Twitch ✗, Kick ✗** (the latter two have no write API
— hide the field for them; the capability descriptor drives this automatically).
**Can't reuse `auth.obsproject.com`** (OBS's own proxy) — use direct platform flows + our own
registered OAuth clients. **Kick has no public-client path** — embed an (obfuscated) client secret
or run a thin token-exchange proxy.

### Candidate providers beyond the MVP three (2026-06-28 research)

The registry is designed so these slot in later without touching the modal/engine.

- **Facebook Page Live — FEASIBLE, validates the thumbnail path, but highest-friction auth.**
  `POST /{page-id}/live_videos` → RTMPS ingest + a live-video id; sets `title`, `description`,
  `privacy`, `content_tags` (generic interest IDs — **no real game/category catalog** since
  Facebook Gaming was sunset). **Thumbnail:** `POST /{video-id}/thumbnails` exists (so FB is a
  second thumbnail-capable provider) — *but whether it applies before/during a live (vs only the
  saved VOD) is unverified; test before committing.* **Auth = auth-code + client-secret via an
  embedded webview** — Meta supports **no device flow, no PKCE loopback**, and its policy says
  **don't embed the secret in a binary** → this provider needs the **proxy** auth strategy (or an
  accepted-risk embed). **Meta App Review is a hard gate** (dev mode only reaches app
  admins/testers — same shape as Google's verification, possibly stricter). 60-day tokens, no
  silent refresh; Graph API has a ~2-yr-per-version deprecation cadence = ongoing maintenance.
  → Slots in as a `facebook` provider using the `auth-code+secret`/`proxy` strategy; good test of
  the thumbnail-capable + lifecycle + proxy paths. Schedule **after** the MVP three.
- **Instagram — NOT FEASIBLE via official API; do not plan a built-in.** Instagram exposes **no
  programmatic live API** for third parties: the Content Publishing API has no live CREATE path,
  and Instagram Live Producer keys are browser-only and **cannot be retrieved via API** (Meta:
  "no plans to build one"). The only path is the user manually pasting a browser-obtained stream
  key into a normal RTMP profile (which already works) — there's nothing for the app to *own*.
  Document as out-of-scope; revisit only if Meta ships a live API.

So the realistic provider set is **Twitch · Kick · YouTube · (later) Facebook Page**, spanning
all four auth strategies — which is exactly why the registry/strategy abstraction is the core of
this phase.

### Portable from `frontend_old/` (the CEF rewrite dropped it)

- `frontend_old/oauth/{Auth,OAuth,TwitchAuth,YoutubeAuth,RestreamAuth}.{cpp,hpp}` — vanilla
  OAuth2 (auth-code + refresh, loopback) — flow logic portable; Qt coupling thin.
- `frontend_old/utility/YoutubeApiWrappers.*` + `dialogs/OBSYoutubeActions.*` — the FULL YouTube
  metadata + broadcast lifecycle (insert/bind/transition, categories, `videos.update`,
  `thumbnails/set`). The richest reference; rebuild its UI in Svelte, port the API calls.
- Twitch/Restream old code = stream-key fetch only (no metadata UI). **No Kick code anywhere.**
- Build-cred pattern ALREADY present: CMake cacheVars from env (`TWITCH_CLIENTID`/`_HASH`,
  `YOUTUBE_CLIENTID`/`_SECRET`/`_HASH`, `RESTREAM_*`), XOR-obfuscated via `utility/obf.h`; CI
  already injects `secrets.TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`. Add `KICK_*` the same way.

### Proposed architecture

- **OAuth + platform API calls live in the C++ bridge**, not the JS bundle — keeps client
  secrets out of the shipped web assets, runs the loopback HTTP listener / device-code polling
  natively, and reuses the portable old OAuth logic. New bridge methods (sketch):
  `oauth.connect{platform}` / `oauth.disconnect` / `oauth.status`, `streamMeta.getCategories`
  (search/typeahead), `streamMeta.get`/`streamMeta.set{profile, fields}`. Svelte owns the modal.
- **Token store:** `%APPDATA%/obs-multistream/oauth_tokens.json` (ideally DPAPI-wrapped on
  Windows; at least not world-readable). Per-platform refresh handling.
- **Account ↔ profile link:** a connected OAuth account attaches to a stream profile (which
  already carries platform + key); metadata editing for a destination requires its account
  connected (inline "Connect…" otherwise).
- **Go Live modal flow:** click Go Live → modal lists each armed destination grouped by
  platform/account → platform-conditional fields (title/category/tags everywhere; thumbnail +
  privacy/description for YouTube) → confirm pushes metadata per platform, then `streaming.start`;
  partial-failure tolerant (warn, still allow going live). Also reachable mid-stream to edit.

### Proposed phasing

- **8a — OAuth foundation + first platform (Twitch). ✅ DONE 2026-06-29** (commits
  `6b0c72464`..`e613f3130`, branch `ui-redesign`). Bridge OAuth (device-code flow, no secret),
  DPAPI-wrapped per-profile token store, provider registry + `StreamProvider`/`AuthStrategy`
  interfaces, reusable `DeviceCodeStrategy`, `TwitchProvider` (Helix users/channels/search +
  `PATCH /helix/channels`, reactive-401, stream-key autofill), Streams **Connect Account / Use
  Stream Key** dual path + device-code connect modal, `streamMeta` get/set/category-search,
  `oauth.*` bridge methods. 5 tasks subagent-driven + holistic review (super-quality =
  SHIP_WITH_FIXES, 0 Critical); the 3 foundation Important items fixed (atomic token write,
  scopeVer enforcement, single-flight refresh coherence) + minors. check 0/0, build EXIT=0, smoke
  148 methods / leaks 2 / clean shutdown. **Acceptance owed (needs a real Twitch client id + GUI):**
  live connect round-trip, scopeVer-refusal, concurrent-refresh coherence, DPAPI write/read — all
  compile-clean + logic-reviewed but unexercised in portable smoke (`provider registry booted: 0`).
- **8b — Go Live modal. ✅ DONE 2026-06-29** (`a45973a07`,`1bbaf21bb`). Added a deferred-callback
  **async bridge dispatch lane** (`g_asyncMethods`/`RunAsyncMethod`/`DispatchAsync`) and moved
  `streamMeta.get/searchCategories/set` onto it (JS `await` contract unchanged; the shared lane
  8c/8d reuse). `GoLiveModal` renders entirely from capability descriptors via one
  `GoLiveFieldInput` (all 8 field types); shared-defaults block = union of every shareable field;
  per-destination override cards (empty inherits, filled overrides) per the mock; Simple/Advanced.
  Confirm pushes resolved metadata per armed+connected destination (partial-failure tolerant), then
  `streaming.start`. General toggle "Ask for stream info on Go Live" (default on) + Edit-stream-info
  button (works mid-stream). Review SHIP_WITH_FIXES (0 Crit): fixed primary-enabled-before-load,
  collapsed triplicated rendering into one descriptor-driven path, and a same-account token clobber
  reopened by going concurrent (ensureFresh is now the sole token writer).
- **8c — Kick. ✅ DONE 2026-06-29** (`3d22ebb9f`). Reusable **PKCE-loopback** strategy (127.0.0.1
  ephemeral Winsock listener, S256, CSRF state) + a generalized strategy-agnostic `authorize()`
  connect flow (`oauth.connectProgress {phase}`; device-code & browser-wait UX). `KickProvider`:
  `channel:read/write`+`user:read`, `PATCH /public/v1/channels`, `/public/v2/categories` typeahead,
  identity+channel-read prefill; redirect host `localhost` (Kick's Next.js rewrites `127.0.0.1`).
  Review SHIP_WITH_FIXES (0 Crit): reactive-401 now force-refreshes through the persisting
  single-flight path (Kick refresh tokens rotate), worker try/catch, category-id string wire type.
- **8d — YouTube. ✅ DONE 2026-06-29** (`033f45a2b`). PKCE-loopback (no secret; `access_type=offline`
  +`prompt=consent` via `Config.extraAuthParams`) + create-per-go-live lifecycle: liveBroadcasts.
  insert → liveStreams.insert → bind → videos.update (category/tags) → thumbnails.set, then writes
  the RTMP ingest URL+key into the linked profile (UI-thread `ingest_writeback`, completes before
  `streaming.start`). **enableAutoStart always true** so YouTube auto-transitions when the encoder
  connects (no manual transition hook); advanced toggle controls only `enableAutoStop`. 11-field
  descriptor (privacy/description/thumbnail + YouTube-only advanced). Review SHIP_WITH_FIXES (0 Crit;
  writeback sync + videos.update merge affirmed correct). Also standardized all providers'
  enum/labelset options on `{value,label}` (fixed Twitch language/content-labels rendering as
  `[object Object]`). **`YOUTUBE_CLIENTID` must be a Google "Desktop app" OAuth client** (Web clients
  reject loopback redirects). **Google app-verification paperwork (sensitive scope) still owed.**
- **8e — Polish. ✅ DONE 2026-06-29** (`406fc9f56`). Thumbnail preview + remove + drag-drop + 2 MB
  hint; **reconnect UX** for stale-scope tokens (distinct "⚠ Reconnect" state in Streams; excluded
  from the modal push + shown as "authorization expired" — still streams via key); human
  platform-named partial-failure toasts. (Mid-stream edit + debounced typeahead already shipped in
  8b.) Frontend-only; check 0/0, build EXIT=0.
- **Phase 8 MVP (8a–8e) COMPLETE + pushed to `origin/ui-redesign`; NOT merged.** Acceptance owed
  (live, can't headless — needs the registered apps + creds): real connect round-trips per platform,
  metadata push, YouTube create-per-go-live + auto-transition + thumbnail + ingest writeback, Kick
  variable-loopback-port acceptance (RFC 8252), refresh/reconnect, DPAPI read/write. NOTE: portable
  smoke shows clean `[obs] shutdown complete` (leaks 2) but an intermittent **CEF-exit segfault**
  appears in the headless shell (reproduces with the pre-8e bundle; subagents smoke the same binary
  clean; outside OBS's crash handler) — a teardown/GPU artifact, not a Phase 8 regression; confirm
  close behavior in a real GUI session.
- **8f — Facebook Page (optional, post-MVP).** A `facebook` provider on the `auth-code+secret`/
  `proxy` strategy: `live_videos` create + title/description/privacy + `thumbnails` upload (test
  the live-timing gap first). Requires a token-exchange proxy (or accepted-risk embedded secret)
  and Meta App Review (start that paperwork before building). **Instagram is excluded** — no
  official live API.

### Open decisions (resolve before building)

1. **Thumbnail YouTube-only** acceptable? (Twitch/Kick can't via API.)
2. **Kick secret:** embed obfuscated in the binary (open-source tradeoff, like OBS's old Twitch)
   vs run a thin token-exchange proxy? (Recommend embed for now.)
3. **YouTube model:** create-a-broadcast-per-go-live (OBS style, full control) vs update-the-
   existing/auto-created broadcast? (Recommend create-per-go-live — matches the old dialog.)
4. **OAuth in the C++ bridge** (recommended, secrets out of JS) confirmed?
5. Sequencing: **Twitch → Kick → YouTube** (by API simplicity + verification gate) confirmed?
6. **Facebook Page** — in scope as a later provider (8f)? It needs a **token-exchange proxy**
   (Meta forbids embedding the secret + has no device/PKCE flow) and App Review. Are we willing to
   run a tiny proxy service? If not, Facebook (and any future secret-required, no-public-flow
   provider) is embed-with-accepted-risk or dropped.
7. **Instagram** — confirmed out-of-scope (no official live API; manual key paste only)?

### Risks

- Google verification gate (sensitive scope) — weeks; 100-user cap until done. Start early.
- Kick API youngest/least-documented; no device flow; secret required. Build defensively (backoff,
  undocumented rate limits).
- Refresh-token lifecycle differs per platform (Twitch one-time-use + 30-day inactivity).
- Secret handling: embedded secrets are extractable — obfuscate + accept, or proxy.

## Phase 9 — Creator engagement layer: multichat, viewer count, alerts & widgets 🚧 9.0 DONE; rest planned

**9.0 (Multichat + Aggregate Viewer Count) ✅ DONE 2026-06-30** (commits `0b1725b24`,`c016fe362`,
`7bcccb808` on `ui-redesign`; spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-phase9-multichat-viewer-count-design.md`).
C++ chat transport layer on the Phase 8 registry: a libcurl-WebSocket client, a `ChatTransport`
interface + `ChatHub` (one worker per connected account, normalized messages → `chat.message`/
`chat.state` events, `chat.send` routing, start-on-go-live/stop-on-stop), and three transports —
Twitch IRC-over-WS, YouTube `liveChatMessages` long-poll, Kick Pusher (reverse-engineered) read +
REST send. Aggregate viewer count via a `ViewerPoller` + per-provider `viewerCount()` hook →
`viewers.changed` (Monitor card + Studio chip). Svelte virtualized multichat dock (native
emotes/badges, escaped text, all/per-platform send box). Chat scopes added (Twitch
`chat:read`/`chat:edit` + future EventSub `user:read:chat`/`user:write:chat`; Kick `chat:write`/
`events:subscribe`) with scopeVer bumps. Holistic review = SHIP_WITH_FIXES (0 Critical; 4 Important
fixed: Twitch reauth-budget reset, host-side fallback message id + client-seq dock key, Kick
teardown-timeout, Monitor/YouTube clear-on-stop). Also fixed the **`.env` credential wiring** (CMake
now auto-loads a CR-tolerant repo-root `.env` under the `.env`/CI names → Twitch/Kick/YouTube boot).
check 0/0, build EXIT=0, smoke 3 providers / leaks 2 / clean OBS shutdown. **GUI/credential
acceptance owed** (headless can't drive real chat): per-platform connect/read/send, viewer counts,
esp. the reverse-engineered Kick Pusher path (app key/`/api/v2` chatroom id/slug casing) + a >4h
Twitch session (reauth) + an empty-id message. NOT merged to master.

**9.1 (Third-party emotes — Twitch) ✅ DONE 2026-07-01** (`ui-redesign`). 7TV + BetterTTV +
FrankerFaceZ emotes in the Twitch multichat feed, host-side only (the dock already renders
emote fragments). On connect the channel's numeric id is resolved via Helix, then six
best-effort GETs load each provider's global + channel sets into one code→url map (channel
over global; 7TV > BTTV > FFZ); a post-pass over `BuildFragments` swaps whole-word
case-sensitive matches in text fragments for emote fragments, leaving native Twitch emotes
untouched. Fetches are non-fatal, poll the cancel token before each request (5s timeout), and
resolve only https URLs. Runtime substitution owed a live-session check.

**Remaining Phase 9 (planned):** moderation · alerts/events feed · overlay widgets (local HTTP
server + widget pages) · chat-as-source · third-party emotes for Kick/YouTube · pre-live chat.

**Goal:** the Streamlabs/StreamElements-style live layer the fork lacks — unified **multichat**
(read+send across every connected platform in one pane), **aggregate viewer count** (sum of live
viewers across destinations), and the broader **alerts / events / overlay widgets** family
(follows, subs, donations, chat-as-a-source, viewer goals). This is the natural payoff of the
Phase 8 OAuth foundation: the same provider registry + per-profile accounts now also carry the
**chat + events** scopes (Kick `chat:write`/`events:subscribe`, Twitch chat/EventSub, YouTube
liveChat), so engagement features ride the existing connection rather than a new auth stack.

**Why it builds on Phase 8 cleanly:** the `StreamProvider` registry is already the extensibility
seam. Phase 9 adds, per provider, optional **chat** + **event** capability hooks (connect to the
platform's chat transport, normalize messages/events to a common shape) — adding a platform's chat
stays ~one module, mirroring how metadata providers slot in. Enable the extra OAuth scopes now
(Kick form: Write to Chat feed + Subscribe to events; Twitch: chat scopes; YouTube: youtube
scope already covers liveChat) so accounts connected today are forward-compatible.

**Candidate sub-features (to brainstorm/sequence later):**
- **Multichat dock** — one merged, platform-tagged feed; send-to-all or per-platform; moderation
  actions where scoped. Per-platform chat transports: Twitch IRC/EventSub, Kick (chat:write +
  events:subscribe / Pusher), YouTube liveChatMessages.
- **Aggregate viewer count** — poll/subscribe each live destination's viewer count; show total +
  per-platform breakdown (a Monitor-page card + a Studio bar chip).
- **Alerts / events feed** — follows / subs / gifts / (Kick) Kicks / (YT) superchat → a normalized
  event stream driving on-screen alert widgets + a Studio events ticker.
- **Overlay widgets as browser sources** — alert box, chat box, viewer-goal, recent-events — local
  widget pages the user adds as browser sources (and/or a built-in overlay compositor on a canvas).
- **Chat as a source** — render the merged chat into a scene (browser source or native).

**Open questions for the Phase 9 brainstorm:** widget hosting (local HTTP server for browser-source
widget pages vs native overlay render); event transport per platform (poll vs websocket/EventSub);
whether to compose overlays on a dedicated canvas; donation/tip integrations (likely third-party,
e.g. StreamElements/Streamlabs tip APIs) and whether those are in scope. Formalize after Phase 8
ships and the platform accounts/scopes are proven.

## Backlog & deferred decisions ⏸

- ⏸ **GoLive / Multitrack Video** — currently dormant. It's Twitch Enhanced
  Broadcasting (many quality renditions → one Twitch ingest), orthogonal to our
  many-platforms goal. Decision at the multi-destination phase: delete the
  Twitch-specific `GoLiveAPI`/config, or harvest `MultitrackVideoOutput`'s
  multi-output/encoder-sharing plumbing for our fan-out handler.
- ⏸ **WHIP simulcast encoder-id divergence** — conscious deferral from 4b.
- ✅ **C1 — output-binding edits now honor Settings → Cancel.** Edits still commit
  live (previews react immediately), but the dialog snapshots the bindings on open,
  reverts on Cancel/Esc, and re-baselines on Apply/OK — mirroring the Stream tab.
  See `docs/issues.md` #3 C1.
- ✅ **Canvas-editor input clamping** — FPS num/den (`setRange(1, …)`), SDR white
  level (`setRange(80, 480)`), and the `WxH` parse (`cx > 0 && cy > 0`) already
  floor every numeric input above 0 through the dialog; no separate guard needed.
- ✅ **`canvas-foundation` branch** — Phases 1–3 merged to `master` (fast-forward) +
  pushed to origin 2026-06-21. Phase 4 (frontend rewrite) continues on the
  `frontend-rewrite` branch (off `master`).
